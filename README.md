# Code-review
Every second Friday we meet to discuss how our code can be become more efficient, reproducible and user-friendly. This is a page to collect useful links and provide a place for sharing code.

## Next session
- Friday 8/11 : [Unit-testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
 >Edoardo will present how unit-testing works in the [statcheck](http://statcheck.io/) package, providing us a framework for a general discussion about unit-testing in R.

## Potential upcoming topics
- Check if your code is reproducible and understandable
- How to use the Lisa cluster and supercomputers
- ggplot2


## Learning the basics of R
- [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) is a great R-package that teaches the very fundamentals of R interactively inside of R itself. Perfect for someone who has never programmed before, and the webpage starts from explaining how to install R and R-studio.
-  [Learning statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/introR.html) is a nice book freely available online by Danielle Navarro, which teaches statistics using R and includes a fundamental explanation of how R works.


## Efficient programming
- [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html) by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace is a great book freely available online for learning the basics of efficient progamming in R.

## Learn Git and Github
- [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) offers a nice-looking beginner's course. You don't need to get the paid account.
- [KataKoda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git) has beginner's to advanced courses on Git
- The [Github Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) is a good way to familiarize yourself with Github.
- [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) is a useful tool if you would like a more user-friendly overview of your commit history and when solving merge conflicts. Free to use, but will occasionally remind you there is a paid version.
