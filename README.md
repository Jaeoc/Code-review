# Code-review
Every second Friday from 11 to 12 we meet at Tilburg's MTO department to discuss how our code can be become more efficient, reproducible and user-friendly. This is a central landing page with information and useful links.

There is a private [OSF repository](https://osf.io/mr7a6/) so that you can upload your code without concern that it will be public. Just click on the link and request access. If you do not have an OSF account you will have to create one first.

## Next session
- Friday 28/2: Code reviewing
> Bring your code for discussion/help, or bring yourself to help others/be inspired

## Learning the basics of R
- [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) is a great R-package that teaches the very fundamentals of R interactively inside of R itself. Perfect for someone who has never programmed before, and the webpage starts from explaining how to install R and R-studio.
-  [Learning statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/introR.html) is a nice book freely available online by Danielle Navarro, which teaches statistics using R and includes a fundamental explanation of how R works.


## Efficient programming
- [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html) by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace is a great book freely available online for learning the basics of efficient progamming in R.

## Learn Git and Github
- [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) offers a nice-looking beginner's course. You don't need to get the paid account.
- [KataKoda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git) has beginner's to advanced courses on Git
- The [Github Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) is a good way to familiarize yourself with Github.
- [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) is a useful tool if you would like a more user-friendly overview of your commit history and when solving merge conflicts. Free to use, but will occasionally remind you there is a paid version.
